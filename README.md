 #### I forked the repository but some questions were added only after that. How do I access those?
  Open Git Bash or your Command Prompt and navigate over to your forked repository. Enter the following commands:
  ```bash
  git remote add origin https://github.com/SVCE-HacktoberFest2019/AlgorithmsDaily.git
  git fetch origin
  git merge origin/master
  ```
  #### What do I do if I see a merge conflict?
This does not happen until you modify an existing file in the repository. The easiest thing to do is to make a copy of your code outside the repository and then clone it once again. Merge it to the `master` branch, add your code and continue contributing :).
